# GO_prediction
Problem Statement: Predicting the best-suited gene ontology terms for respective proteins or RNA. 
Objective of Project: The objective of this work is to predict Gene ontology terms using supervised learning techniques related to each protein in the human genome. Proteins perform several functions in the body which are organised into a standard vocabulary in terms of gene ontology terms which enables us to computationally annotate these proteins. This Go term helps us to identify the molecular functionalities, cellular components, and biological processes of each protein sequence. 
Outcome:
1.Predicting respective GO terms associated with each Protein or RNA
2.These GO terms help in understanding the molecular functionality of each Protein.
